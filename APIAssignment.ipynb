    "Advantages:\n",
    "1) Increasced efficiency: By using API's allow different system software to communicate and exchange data.\n",
    "2) Improved User Experience: By intergrating with API's application can offer user a better experience.\n",
    "3) Scalability: API are designed to be scalable and can handle large volumne of data set\n",
    "4) Access to new market: API access to new market or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantage:\n",
    "1) Security risk: API can introduce security risk if not properly secured \n",
    "2) Complexity: API can be complex and integrate to use especially if API provider does not provide proper document\n",
    "3) Dependency on third parties: An new application in market is always depended on API. if provider stop giving API key,\n",
    "or change polices it will tends new application using API to go down and loose it market.\n",
    "4) Cost: Some popular named API are very expensive which can be barrier to small business."
